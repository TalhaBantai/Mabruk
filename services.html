    <summary>Fire Fighting Systems</summary>
    <p>Fire fighting systems are designed to suppress and extinguish fires. They include components like sprinkler systems that automatically detect and spray water, fire suppression systems that use foam or chemicals, and fire hose reels for manual intervention. These systems are crucial for protecting lives and property by controlling and preventing the spread of fire.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="service-item">
    <summary>Fire Alarm Systems</summary>
    <p>Fire alarm systems detect fires early, alerting occupants and emergency services. They use devices like smoke detectors, heat detectors, and manual pull stations connected to a control panel. When a fire is detected, the system activates audible and visual alarms to facilitate evacuation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="service-item">
    <summary>Fire Extinguishers</summary>
    <p>Fire extinguishers are portable devices used to put out small fires. They contain various agents like water, CO2, or dry chemicals, each effective for different types of fires. Fire extinguishers are essential for initial fire suppression, preventing minor incidents from escalating.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="service-item">
    <summary>Access Control Systems</summary>
    <p>Access control systems restrict entry to authorized personnel, enhancing security. They use methods like key cards, biometric scans, or PIN codes to verify identity. These systems manage and monitor who enters or exits a building, ensuring only those with permission can access specific areas.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="service-item">
    <summary>CCTV Camera</summary>
    <p>CCTV (closed-circuit television) systems use video cameras to monitor and record activities. They are used for surveillance in various settings, providing real-time and recorded footage. CCTV systems help deter crime, monitor processes, and ensure safety.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="service-item">
    <summary>Gas Detection System</summary>
    <p>Gas detection systems identify the presence of hazardous gases, ensuring safety in environments where leaks can occur. They use sensors to detect combustible, flammable, or toxic gases, triggering alarms to alert personnel. These systems are vital in industries like oil rigs, manufacturing plants, and firefighting.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="service-item">
        <summary>AMC of Existing Fire Fighting System</summary>
        <p>Annual Maintenance Contracts (AMC) ensure the reliability and effectiveness of fire fighting systems. These contracts cover regular inspection, testing, and maintenance of equipment, including fire extinguishers, fire alarms, and sprinkler systems. AMC services help to comply with safety regulations and ensure systems are always in optimal working condition.</p>
